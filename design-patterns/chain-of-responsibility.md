## Chain of Responsibility 
The Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to pass a request along a chain of potential handlers until the request is handled by one of the objects in the chain. It decouples senders and receivers of a request by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.

In this pattern, each object in the chain has a reference to its successor. When a request is made, it's passed to the first object in the chain. This object can either handle the request or pass it to the next object in the chain. This process continues until the request is handled or until it reaches the end of the chain with no handler found.

The Chain of Responsibility pattern promotes loose coupling and allows you to add or remove handlers dynamically. It also gives you the flexibility to specify different handlers for different scenarios and easily modify the chain without affecting the client code.

Let's consider a real-world example of an employee leave approval system implemented using the Chain of Responsibility pattern in C#.

```csharp
using System;

// Abstract base class for leave approvers
abstract class LeaveApprover
{
    protected LeaveApprover successor;

    public void SetSuccessor(LeaveApprover successor)
    {
        this.successor = successor;
    }

    public virtual void ApproveLeave(LeaveRequest request)
    {
        if (CanApprove(request))
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"{GetType().Name} approved leave for {request.EmployeeName}.");
        }
        else if (successor != null)
        {
            successor.ApproveLeave(request);
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"No leave approver could handle the request for {request.EmployeeName}.");
        }
    }

    protected abstract bool CanApprove(LeaveRequest request);
}

// Concrete leave approver class for team leads
class TeamLead : LeaveApprover
{
    protected override bool CanApprove(LeaveRequest request)
    {
        return request.LeaveDays <= 2;
    }
}

// Concrete leave approver class for managers
class Manager : LeaveApprover
{
    protected override bool CanApprove(LeaveRequest request)
    {
        return request.LeaveDays <= 5;
    }
}

// Concrete leave approver class for directors
class Director : LeaveApprover
{
    protected override bool CanApprove(LeaveRequest request)
    {
        return request.LeaveDays <= 10;
    }
}

// Leave request class
class LeaveRequest
{
    public string EmployeeName { get; }
    public int LeaveDays { get; }

    public LeaveRequest(string employeeName, int leaveDays)
    {
        EmployeeName = employeeName;
        LeaveDays = leaveDays;
    }
}

// Usage example
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create leave approvers
        var teamLead = new TeamLead();
        var manager = new Manager();
        var director = new Director();

        // Set up the chain of responsibility
        teamLead.SetSuccessor(manager);
        manager.SetSuccessor(director);

        // Leave requests
        var request1 = new LeaveRequest("John", 3);
        var request2 = new LeaveRequest("Alice", 7);
        var request3 = new LeaveRequest("Bob", 12);

        // Process leave requests
        teamLead.ApproveLeave(request1);
        teamLead.ApproveLeave(request2);
        teamLead.ApproveLeave(request3);
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an employee leave approval system where leave requests are processed by a chain of leave approvers based on their authority levels. The abstract base class `LeaveApprover` defines the common interface for approving leave requests and maintains a reference to the next approver in the chain (`successor`). Each concrete approver class (`TeamLead`, `Manager`, `Director`) implements the `CanApprove` method to check if they have the authority to approve the leave request.

In the `ApproveLeave` method, each approver checks if they can approve the leave request based on their authority level. If they can, the leave request is approved; otherwise, the request is passed to the next approver in the chain. This process continues until the request is approved or reaches the end of the chain.

In the usage example, we create instances of the leave approvers, set up the chain of responsibility by linking them together, and then process leave requests using the first approver in the chain (`teamLead`). The leave requests are passed through the chain, and each approver approves the request if they have the authority to do so.

This way, you can easily add or remove leave approvers, change their order, and handle leave requests dynamically by modifying the chain without affecting the client code.

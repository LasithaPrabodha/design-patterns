## Factory Method ðŸ”¥
The Factory Method design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It encapsulates the object creation logic in a separate method, referred to as the factory method, which is implemented by the subclasses.

The main idea behind the Factory Method is to define an interface (or abstract class) for creating objects, while deferring the actual instantiation to the subclasses. This way, the client code that uses the factory method is decoupled from the specific classes it creates, and it only depends on the common interface.

Here's how the Factory Method pattern typically works:

1. Define an abstract class or interface that declares the factory method. This method should return an object of a related class.

2. Create concrete subclasses that implement the factory method. Each subclass decides which class to instantiate based on its specific implementation.

3. The client code uses the factory method to create objects without directly instantiating specific classes. It only interacts with the abstract interface or base class.

By using the Factory Method pattern, you can achieve several benefits:

1. Flexibility: The pattern allows adding new product classes without modifying the existing client code. You can simply introduce a new subclass that implements the factory method.

2. Extensibility: Clients can rely on the abstract interface or base class, making it easier to extend or customize the creation of objects.

3. Encapsulation: The creation logic is encapsulated within the factory method and its subclasses, isolating it from the client code.

4. Dependency Inversion: The pattern promotes dependency inversion by making the client code depend on abstractions (interfaces or base classes) rather than concrete implementations.

Overall, the Factory Method pattern promotes loose coupling, encapsulation, and flexibility in object creation, making it a useful design pattern in various scenarios.


Here's an example of the Factory Method design pattern implemented in C#:

```cs
using System;

// Abstract Product
abstract class Animal
{
    public abstract void Sound();
}

// Concrete Products
class Dog : Animal
{
    public override void Sound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog: Woof!");
    }
}

class Cat : Animal
{
    public override void Sound()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Cat: Meow!");
    }
}

// Abstract Creator
abstract class AnimalCreator
{
    public abstract Animal CreateAnimal();

    public void SomeOperation()
    {
        // Perform some operations before or after creating the animal
        Animal animal = CreateAnimal();
        animal.Sound();
    }
}

// Concrete Creators
class DogCreator : AnimalCreator
{
    public override Animal CreateAnimal()
    {
        return new Dog();
    }
}

class CatCreator : AnimalCreator
{
    public override Animal CreateAnimal()
    {
        return new Cat();
    }
}

// Client Code
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a Dog using the DogCreator
        AnimalCreator dogCreator = new DogCreator();
        dogCreator.SomeOperation(); // Output: Dog: Woof!

        // Create a Cat using the CatCreator
        AnimalCreator catCreator = new CatCreator();
        catCreator.SomeOperation(); // Output: Cat: Meow!
    }
}
```

In this example, we have an abstract `Animal` class representing the abstract product. It defines an abstract method `Sound()` that the concrete products (`Dog` and `Cat`) implement.

The abstract class `AnimalCreator` serves as the abstract creator. It declares the factory method `CreateAnimal()` which returns an object of the `Animal` class. It also provides a common method `SomeOperation()` that performs some operations before or after creating the animal object. The concrete creators (`DogCreator` and `CatCreator`) inherit from the `AnimalCreator` and override the `CreateAnimal()` method to instantiate the specific concrete products.

In the client code, we create an instance of the `DogCreator` and call `SomeOperation()` to create a `Dog` object and invoke its `Sound()` method. Similarly, we create an instance of the `CatCreator` and call `SomeOperation()` to create a `Cat` object and invoke its `Sound()` method.

The Factory Method pattern allows the client code to create objects without specifying their concrete classes, promoting flexibility and loose coupling.

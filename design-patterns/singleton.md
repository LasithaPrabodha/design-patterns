## Singleton ðŸ”¥
The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single object. It ensures that there is only one instance of a class throughout the application and provides a global point of access to that instance.

The Singleton pattern is useful in scenarios where you need to control the creation and access to a shared resource, such as a database connection, file system, or configuration settings. It guarantees that all requests for the object will return the same instance, and it also provides a convenient way to access that instance from anywhere in the application.

Here's an example of implementing the Singleton pattern in C#:

```cs
public class Singleton
{
    private static Singleton instance;
    private static readonly object lockObject = new object();

    private Singleton() { }

    public static Singleton Instance
    {
        get
        {
            if (instance == null)
            {
                lock (lockObject)
                {
                    if (instance == null)
                    {
                        instance = new Singleton();
                    }
                }
            }
            return instance;
        }
    }

    public void SomeMethod()
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Singleton` class has a private constructor to prevent external instantiation. The `Instance` property is responsible for creating and returning the singleton instance. It uses double-check locking to ensure thread-safety during the creation of the instance.

You can access the singleton instance like this:

```cs
Singleton singleton = Singleton.Instance;
singleton.SomeMethod();
```

By calling `Singleton.Instance`, you obtain the same instance of the Singleton class throughout your application.
